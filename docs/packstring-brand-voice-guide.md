# Packstring — Brand Voice & Copywriting Guide
**For AI agents, developers, and copywriters working on Packstring sites and materials**
Version 1.0 · Companion to the Packstring UI Style Guide

---

## How to Use This Document

This guide governs all written content produced under the Packstring brand. It covers two distinct voices:

1. **The Outfitter Site Voice** — copy that appears on client websites (trip descriptions, hero text, about pages, form UX, CTAs)
2. **The Packstring Sales Voice** — copy that sells the Packstring service to outfitters (the pitch page, outreach emails, sales decks)

Read the relevant section before writing any copy. When in doubt, read the examples — they're the fastest way to calibrate.

---

## Part 1: The Outfitter Site Voice

### The Showman's Rule

The default voice is lean, muscular, and restrained. But in **short-form blocks only** — trip cards, badge lines, seasonal callouts — one line of theater is allowed per block. One hook. One sentence that reframes a fact as something you can't scroll past.

This is not permission to be clever everywhere. It's permission to be clever *once*, in a small space, surrounded by facts. The restraint everywhere else is what makes the one moment land.

**Where the hook is allowed:**
- Trip cards (1 sentence max)
- Package taglines (1 sentence max)
- Seasonal callouts (1 phrase)

**Where it is not allowed:**
- Hero headlines (stay declarative)
- Trip detail pages (stay lean)
- Guide bios (stay respectful)
- Form UX copy (stay helpful)
- Sales pitch copy (stay blunt)

### Who's Talking (Outfitter Sites)

The voice on an outfitter's site is a **third-person cinematic narrator**. Not the guide himself, not a brochure, not a tourism board. Think of it as the voice-over in a short film about the operation — someone who has been on the river, seen the elk come through the timber, and is telling you what it's like with authority and restraint.

The narrator knows the guide's story and tells it with respect. The narrator has been there but doesn't make it about himself.

**The narrator is not:**
- The guide talking about himself ("I've been guiding for 25 years...")
- A marketing department ("Our world-class team of experienced professionals...")
- A tourism brochure ("Discover the magic of Montana's breathtaking wilderness!")
- A buddy at a bar ("Dude, you gotta try this trip")

**The narrator is:**
- A steady voice with dirt under its nails
- Someone who has earned the right to tell this story
- Confident without being loud
- Present in the landscape, not above it

### Writing Style: Lean and Muscular

Short sentences. Active verbs. Concrete nouns. No filler, no fluff, no adjective stacking. Every sentence earns its place or gets cut.

The style borrows from Hemingway — not the parody of Hemingway (caveman grunts), but the real discipline: saying more with less, trusting the reader to feel what you don't spell out. A great trip description should read like good campfire storytelling. You don't explain why it was beautiful. You describe what happened, and the beauty is obvious.

**The rules:**

1. **One idea per sentence.** If a sentence has a comma and an "and," it's probably two sentences.
2. **Concrete over abstract.** "28-inch walleye" not "trophy-class fish." "4:30 AM" not "early morning." "$450" not "competitive pricing."
3. **Verbs do the work.** "The river bends" not "the river is characterized by bends." "Forrest runs jet boats" not "Forrest is experienced in jet boat operation."
4. **No superlatives without evidence.** Don't say "best fishing in Montana." Say "the Missouri below Holter Dam produces more trout per mile than any river in the Lower 48." Let the fact be the superlative.
5. **Cut the warm-up.** Most first sentences are throat-clearing. Delete them and start with the second sentence.
6. **End strong.** The last sentence of every section should land. Not trail off, not summarize — land.

### Tone Calibration

The tone moves between two poles depending on where the reader is in the site.

**Discovery mode** (homepage, hero, trip overview): Atmospheric. A little cinematic. You're setting the scene and building desire. The reader is browsing, dreaming. Give them the movie.

**Decision mode** (trip details, pricing, contact form): Direct. Clear. Practical. The reader is comparing options, checking dates, doing math. Give them the facts fast and get out of the way.

```
Discovery:  "The fog lifts off Canyon Ferry before dawn. The first cast hits the water. 
             By 7 AM, you're into fish."

Decision:   "Full-day trip. Jet boat. All tackle provided. $450 per person, two-person 
             minimum. Book online or call Forrest direct."
```

The site should feel like it shifts gears naturally — cinematic at the top, practical as you scroll down. The reader barely notices the transition.

---

### Copy Patterns by Section

#### Hero Headlines

Short. Declarative. No questions, no cleverness. The headline states what this is. The subhead adds one layer of context. The photo does the rest.

```
✓ "Montana Hunting & Fishing Outfitters"
  "Guided trips from Helena. Over 25 years on the water."

✓ "The Land of Giants"
  "Trophy walleye on the Missouri River. Full-day jet boat trips from Helena."

✓ "Canyon Ferry. Fort Peck. Holter. The Missouri."
  "One guide. Every water worth fishing in central Montana."

✗ "Welcome to the Adventure of a Lifetime!"
✗ "Ready to Experience World-Class Montana Fishing?"
✗ "Your Premier Destination for Unforgettable Outdoor Experiences"
```

#### Trip Cards (Short-Form)

Trip cards are the one place where a single line of theater is encouraged. In a small space — 2-3 sentences max — one hook line can stop a scroll without tipping into salesmanship.

**The rule:** One theatrical sentence per card, max. It should reframe a fact as a hook. The rest stays lean and factual.

```
✓ "They call this stretch the Land of Giants for a reason. Full-day 
   jet boat trip below Holter Dam. Trophy walleye, smallmouth, and pike."

✓ "Three days. Three waters. Three chances to catch something you'll 
   be talking about at Thanksgiving."

✗ "They call this stretch the Land of Giants for a reason. The walleye 
   here grow to sizes that make people take photographs instead of eating 
   dinner. It's the trip you've been dreaming about."
   (Two theatrical lines — one too many for a card.)
```

The hook works because it's surrounded by facts. Facts make the hook credible. The hook makes the facts memorable.

#### Trip Descriptions (Long-Form)

Lead with the setting. Then the experience. Then the practical details. End with the CTA. Keep the voice lean throughout — no theatrical turns in long-form copy. The photography and the facts do the work here.

**Pattern:**
1. One or two sentences setting the scene (where, what it feels like)
2. What the trip involves (method, target species, what the day looks like)
3. What's included
4. Duration, pricing, group size
5. "Book This Trip" button

**Example — good:**

> The Missouri River below Holter Dam runs cold and clear through a canyon most people will never see from a road. This is big-fish water. Forrest has run jet boats through this stretch for two decades, putting clients on walleye, smallmouth, and pike that don't come small.
>
> Full-day trips launch at sunrise from the Gates of the Mountains. All tackle, bait, and instruction provided. Beginners welcome — Forrest has taught hundreds of first-timers to catch fish here.
>
> **Duration:** Full day (8-10 hours on water)
> **Price:** $450 per person, 2-person minimum
> **Season:** March through November
> **Includes:** Jet boat, all tackle, bait, instruction, fish cleaning

**Example — bad:**

> Looking for an amazing fishing experience on Montana's legendary Missouri River? Look no further! Our experienced and knowledgeable guide Captain Forrest has been providing world-class guided fishing adventures for over 25 years. With state-of-the-art jet boat equipment and an unparalleled knowledge of the river, you'll enjoy an unforgettable day on the water targeting a variety of exciting game fish species. Book today to secure your spot on this incredible trip!

The bad example uses 80 words to say nothing specific. The good example puts you on the river in the first sentence.

#### About / Guide Bio

Tell the guide's story, not his resume. Credentials are important — weave them in, don't lead with them.

**Pattern:**
1. Where the guide is from or how they started
2. What they've built (years, scope, specialties)
3. Credentials (licenses, certifications) — stated matter-of-factly
4. What clients can expect from the person, not just the service

**Example:**

> Forrest Fawthrop grew up on the water around Helena. He started guiding before most of his clients had heard of Canyon Ferry. Twenty-five years later, he holds a Montana Outfitter license (#20194) and a U.S. Coast Guard Captain's credential (#3427176), and he's put more people on walleye than he can count.
>
> He runs his own boats, ties his own rigs, and answers his own phone. No booking service, no call center, no middleman. You deal with Forrest, and Forrest deals with the fish.

#### Testimonials

Use real client quotes. Edit only for grammar and clarity — never rewrite a client's voice. Include their name, where they're from, and the trip type if possible.

**Format:**
```
"Best fishing trip I've ever been on. Forrest put us on fish all day 
and the scenery was unbelievable."

— Mark & Sarah Thompson, Dallas, TX · Missouri River Jet Boat, June 2025
```

If a client's testimonial is vague ("Great trip! Would recommend!"), pair it with a more specific one. Lead with the specific testimonial.

#### Seasonal / Availability Callouts

Short, factual, urgent without being pushy.

```
✓ "Now booking: Summer 2026 fishing trips. Weekends fill first."
✓ "Fall elk hunts: 3 spots remaining for October."
✓ "Ice fishing season opens December 15. Book early — Canyon Ferry dates go fast."

✗ "Don't miss out on this incredible opportunity!"
✗ "LIMITED AVAILABILITY — BOOK NOW BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE!!!"
✗ "Spaces are filling up quickly, so act now to avoid disappointment!"
```

#### CTA Buttons and Links

Verb-first. Specific to the action. Never generic.

```
✓ "Book This Trip"
✓ "Reserve Your Dates"
✓ "View Fishing Trips"
✓ "Send an Inquiry"
✓ "Call Forrest Direct"
✓ "See the Gear List"

✗ "Learn More"        (about what?)
✗ "Click Here"         (never)
✗ "Submit"             (on a form — use "Send Inquiry" or "Request Dates")
✗ "Get Started"        (too SaaS)
✗ "Contact Us"         (too corporate — "Book a Trip" or "Send an Inquiry")
```

Exception: "Learn More" is acceptable on trip overview cards that link to a detail page, but only when paired with the trip name context (the card already says what you're learning more about).

#### Form UX Copy

Forms should feel like a conversation, not a government application.

**Labels:** Short. Barlow Semi Condensed, uppercase. Use the standard UI label style.

**Placeholders:** Helpful, not decorative. Written in Lora, normal case.

```
Label: PREFERRED DATES
Placeholder: "June 15–18, or anytime in July"

Label: PARTY SIZE
Options: "Just me" / "2 people" / "3–4 people" / "5+"

Label: EXPERIENCE LEVEL
Options: "First timer" / "Been a few times" / "I know what I'm doing"

Label: MESSAGE
Placeholder: "Tell us about your trip — who's coming, what you're hoping to catch, anything."
```

**Confirmation message after submit:**

> "Got it. Forrest will get back to you within 24 hours — usually faster. In the meantime, here's the gear list so you can start planning: [link]"

Not: "Thank you for your submission! Your inquiry has been received and a member of our team will respond at their earliest convenience."

#### Error and Empty States

Even error messages should sound human.

```
Form validation:  "We need your email to get back to you."
                  "Pick a trip type — or choose 'Not sure yet' if you're still deciding."

Empty gallery:    "Photos coming soon. In the meantime, call Forrest — he's got stories."

404 page:         "Wrong trail. Let's get you back on track."
                  [Button: "Back to Home"] [Button: "View Trips"]
```

| "purchase" | "book" |
| "utilize" | "use" |
| "experience" (as a verb) | describe the specific activity |
| "numerous" | the actual number, or "dozens" |

- "World-renowned"
- Any phrase with an exclamation mark in a heading

#### Montana-Specific Language
- Say "the Missouri" not "the Missouri River" after first mention
- Say "Canyon Ferry" not "Canyon Ferry Lake" after first mention (locals drop "Lake")
- "Helena" is pronounced HELL-uh-nuh — not relevant to written copy but useful context
- Use "guide" not "captain" unless specifically referencing USCG credentials
- "Outfitter" is the licensed business entity; "guide" is the person on the water/in the field

## Part 2: The Packstring Sales Voice

### Who's Talking

This is Firefly Software talking to outfitters — small business owner to small business owner. The voice is direct, knowledgeable, a little blunt, and grounded in Montana.

Think of how a rancher talks to another rancher about a tool that works. No sales pitch. No jargon. Just: here's what it does, here's what it costs, here's why it's better than what you've got.

### Tone

**Direct.** No preamble, no warm-up, no "In today's digital landscape..." Start with the point.

**Blunt about the problem.** Outfitters know their websites are bad. Don't tiptoe. "Your site was built in 2014 and it shows" is more respectful than pretending it's fine.

**Concrete about the solution.** Don't sell "digital presence" or "online strategy." Sell a fast website with an inquiry form that works on phones. Sell more bookings.

**Respectful of the work.** These people run hard operations in rough country. Don't talk down to them. Don't over-explain the internet to them. They know what a website is — they just haven't had a good one.

**Grounded in math.** Outfitters think in trips and dollars. "One extra booking per season pays for your website for the entire year" is the most powerful sentence in the entire pitch.

### Sales Voice Examples

#### Pitch Page Headline

```
✓ "Your clients pay $500 a day. Your website should look like it."

✗ "Transform Your Online Presence with Our Premium Web Solutions"
✗ "Elevate Your Outfitting Business with a Modern Digital Experience"
✗ "Welcome to Packstring — Websites for the Modern Outdoorsman"
```

#### Opening Paragraph

**Good:**

> Montana outfitters run premium experiences. $400 fishing trips, $5,000 elk hunts, $3,500 multi-day packages. But most of them book through websites that haven't been updated since flip phones. The coastal families and out-of-state sportsmen paying these rates expect a professional online presence. When they're comparing three guides, they book with the one whose site looks trustworthy and makes it easy.

**Bad:**

> In today's competitive outdoor recreation market, having a strong digital presence is more important than ever. Potential clients are increasingly turning to the internet to research and book their guided trips, making it essential for outfitters to have a modern, professional website that effectively communicates their brand values and service offerings.

The good version names specific dollar amounts, describes the actual customer, and states the consequence. The bad version says nothing in 50 words.

#### Value Propositions

State the benefit. Then the mechanism. One-two punch.

```
✓ "Stop losing bookings to phone tag."
  An online inquiry form with trip selection, party size, and preferred 
  dates means you wake up to real leads instead of voicemails you can't 
  return from the river.

✓ "Own your business, not a platform."
  No Airbnb commissions, no FishingBooker fees, no WordPress plugin 
  nightmares. Your site, your data, your bookings.

✓ "Look like a $5,000 experience."
  Your website is the first impression for out-of-state clients who've 
  never set foot in Montana. A fast, modern site with real photos and 
  clear trip info converts browsers into booked clients.
```

#### Pricing Copy

State it plainly. No "starting at," no "contact us for pricing." Outfitters respect straight talk.

```
✓ "$500 to build. $35 a month to run. That includes hosting, SSL, 
  DNS, and unlimited content updates. No contracts — month to month."

✓ "That's less than one day's guide fee."

✗ "Contact us for a customized quote tailored to your unique needs."
✗ "Investment starts at just $500 for our standard package."
```

#### Outreach / Cold Email

Short. Specific. No attachments, no links in the first message. Just an honest opening.

**Good:**

> Forrest —
>
> I build websites for Montana outfitters. I looked at mthuntandfishoutfitters.com and I think you're leaving bookings on the table.
>
> You've got great photos and a solid operation, but the site is hard to navigate on a phone and there's no way for someone to send you an inquiry without calling. The out-of-state families comparing you to other guides need an easier path to "yes."
>
> I built a demo of what your site could look like — faster, cleaner, with an online inquiry form. Happy to show you if you're interested. No pressure, no pitch deck.
>
> — [Name], Firefly Software, Helena

**Bad:**

> Dear Mr. Fawthrop,
>
> I hope this email finds you well! My name is [Name] and I'm the founder of Firefly Software, a Montana-based web development company specializing in creating high-performance, mobile-optimized websites for outdoor recreation businesses. I'm reaching out because I believe we could help you take your online presence to the next level and drive more bookings for your outstanding outfitting operation.
>
> I'd love to schedule a 30-minute call to discuss how our Packstring platform could benefit your business...

The good version is 90 words and says something specific about his actual site. The bad version is 95 words of nothing.

#### The Demo Walkthrough Script

When showing the demo to a prospect, the conversation should go:

> "Here's what I built for a Helena fishing and hunting outfitter. Pull up your site on your phone. Now pull up this one. Notice how fast it loads, how easy it is to find trip info, and how the inquiry form works. Which one would you book a $4,000 hunt from?
>
> $500 to build, $35 a month to run. That's less than one day's guide fee."

That's it. The demo does the selling. Don't over-explain. Don't sell features. Show the side-by-side comparison and let the silence do the work.

## Part 3: Universal Rules

These apply to both voices.

### Formatting in Copy

- **No exclamation marks in headings.** Period.
- **One exclamation mark per page maximum** — and only in a testimonial or confirmation message, never in marketing copy.
- **No ALL CAPS in body copy.** Uppercase is reserved for UI labels (Barlow Semi Condensed, small size, with letter-spacing). A sentence in all caps is shouting.
- **Use an em dash (—) not a hyphen (-) for breaks in thought.** Use an en dash (–) for ranges: "June–September," "$400–$600."
- **Numbers under ten: spell out** in body copy. Numbers ten and above: use numerals. Exception: always use numerals for prices, dates, measurements, and license numbers.
- **Use the Oxford comma.** "Walleye, pike, and smallmouth bass."

### Photo Captions

Optional but encouraged. When used, captions should be short, factual, and add information the photo doesn't convey on its own.

```
✓ "Canyon Ferry, October. A 28-inch walleye on a jig and minnow."
✓ "Missouri River below Holter Dam. Drift boat trip, June 2024."

✗ "One of our many happy clients enjoying an incredible day on the water!"
✗ "The stunning beauty of Montana's world-class fisheries."
```

Caption style: Source Code Pro 400, 11px, `--color-stone`.

### Accessibility in Copy

- Don't rely on color alone to communicate meaning (e.g., "click the green button")
- Alt text on every image — descriptive, specific: "Angler holding 28-inch walleye on Canyon Ferry Lake at sunrise" not "fishing photo"
- Link text should describe the destination: "View fishing trips" not "click here"
- Form error messages should name the field: "We need your email" not "Required field"
