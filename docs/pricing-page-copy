## [The Problem — 2-3 short paragraphs]

A family in Connecticut is planning next summer right now. They're comparing three outfitters on their phones. Same price range. Same trip type. One site loads fast, shows real photos, and lets them send an inquiry at midnight. The other two look like they were built during the Obama administration.

Which one do they book?

Most outfitter websites were built on WordPress five or ten years ago. The nav is a maze. The photos are slow. There's no way to check availability or send an inquiry without calling. On a phone, it barely works. Meanwhile, you're running a $5,000 experience out of a $50 website.

## [What Packstring Is — short feature list]

### Headline
A website built for how outfitters actually work.

Packstring is a custom-built website package for Montana hunting and fishing outfitters. Not a template. Not a page builder. Not a marketplace that takes a cut of your bookings.

**Your site. Your brand. Your bookings.**

### What's included

**A fast, mobile-first website** — Custom-built, not a theme. Loads in under two seconds. Looks as good on a phone as it does on a desktop. Because that's where your clients are browsing.

**Trip pages with real pricing** — Every trip type gets its own section with photos, descriptions, what's included, duration, and pricing. No burying the rates three clicks deep. Tourists comparing guides book the one who makes it easy.

**A seasonal availability calendar** — Your clients can see what's open before they call. Open, limited, or booked — color-coded, by trip type, by day. Click an open date and it drops them into the inquiry form with the trip and date already filled in. No other outfitter website does this.

**An inquiry form that works at midnight** — Trip type, dates, party size, experience level, message. You wake up to qualified leads instead of voicemails you can't return from the river. Auto-reply sends your gear list while they wait.

**Stripe deposit collection** — Take a $500 deposit online when you confirm a trip. No reading credit card numbers over the phone. No chasing checks. Professional for you, easy for the client. No commissions — you keep every dollar.

**Google visibility** — Structured data, local SEO, and Google Business Profile optimization so you show up when someone searches "Helena fishing guide" or "Montana elk outfitter."

## [Pricing]

## [What You Don't Get]

No Airbnb-style commissions. No FishingBooker taking 20% of every trip. No WordPress plugin nightmares. No call center — you deal with the developer directly, and the developer deals with your site.

### Headline
We're building the first batch now.

## Page Notes

- Hero photo: full-width Montana landscape (river/mountain, golden hour). Dark overlay with light text.
- The Problem section: no photo needed, just clean text on sand background.
- Features section: could use trip card mockup screenshots or availability calendar screenshot from the demo.
- Pricing section: dark timber background with cream text. Keep it simple — the math does the work.
- Email signup: forest green button, prominent placement. This is the primary conversion goal.
- Total word count target: ~400-500 words visible on page. Short. Every sentence earns its place.
